		<h1>About Anonymous Messages</h1>

			<h2>What is this?</h2>
			<p>Anonymous Messages is a simple platform that lets you send and receive anonymous messages from anyone. Share your unique recipient link with friends, colleagues, or anyone, and they can send you messages without revealing their identity.</p>
			
			<h2>Key Features</h2>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Complete Anonymity</strong> - Messages are sent anonymously, and senders don't need an account</li>
				<li><strong>Easy Sharing</strong> - Get your unique recipient link and share it via link, QR code, or WhatsApp</li>
				<li><strong>Inbox Management</strong> - View all messages you receive in your personal inbox</li>
				<li><strong>Referral Rewards</strong> - Earn R10 rewards when friends sign up using your referral code</li>
				<li><strong>Account Control</strong> - Manage your recipient link, change theme, and delete your account anytime</li>
				<li><strong>Theme Support</strong> - Choose between dark or light theme for comfortable viewing</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h2>How It Works</h2>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Sign Up</strong> - Create an account with a username and password. You get a unique recipient link automatically.</li>
				<li><strong>Share Your Link</strong> - Send your recipient link to anyone you want to receive messages from</li>
				<li><strong>Receive Messages</strong> - Recipients can click your link and send you anonymous messages</li>
				<li><strong>View Inbox</strong> - Check your account inbox to read all messages you've received</li>
				<li><strong>Invite Friends</strong> - Share your referral code and earn R10 for each friend who signs up</li>
			</ol>
			
			<h2>Privacy & Security</h2>
			<p>Your data is stored securely and encrypted. We never share your information with third parties. Senders' identities are kept completely anonymous unless they choose to reveal themselves in their message.</p>
			
			<h2>Rewards System</h2>
			<p>When someone signs up using your referral link or code, both you and the new user receive R10 credit. You can track your rewards in your account dashboard.</p>
